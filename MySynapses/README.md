Thourgh my Applied computer science course, we were guided to build step by step, from scratch, a mobile version of this software.

This was my first project ever coding in Html, CSS, Jscript, and Php ! During this class, we spent much more time on the front-sdie than than on Php. Thus I am more confident in my ability in JScript than in my ability in setting up a server. However, my previous experienc in SQL makes up for that.

We used Cordova to run this app on our phones.

<i> Note : Our servers are running on the school's computers, they're thus down for now. As a result, most of the app isn't working !If you're a recruiter and want it to be operational, please contact me, i will see what I can do   </i>
