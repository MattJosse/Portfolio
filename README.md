Thourgh my Applied computer science course, we were guided to build step by step, from scratch, a mobile version of this software ! 

This was my first project ever coding in Html, CSS, Jscript, and Php ! During this class, we spent much more time on the front-sdie than than on Php. Thus I am more confident in my ability in JScript than in my ability in setting up a server. However, my previous experienc in SQL makes up for that.
